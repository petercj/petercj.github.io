            Hello! I'm currently based in San Francisco. I grew up in Alabama and I studied physics at Princeton and JILA.

            Here are some areas I'm interested in or have been involved with:

            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Hardware Control</b> Why is hardware so hard to program? You can build a web scraper in 45 minutes, but heaven forbid you want to turn a light on and off. I'm working on making hardware as easy as software. Get in touch if you're interested!

            <br>
            <br>
            <b>EUV Technology</b> In order to make smaller transistors, we need to use shorter wavelengths of light. The most advanced semiconductor lithography processes currently use 13.5 nm light extreme ultraviolet (EUV) to print chips. These wavelengths are challenging to generate and control because they are absorbed by atmosphere and don't reflect well off of mirrors. Here's <a href="https://jila.colorado.edu/kmgroup">a link</a> to my old research group.

            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Startup Cities</b> Cities are one of the fundamental units of society, and I think starting new cities is one of the best things we can do to improve them. Existing cities are difficult to change, and sometimes its easier to start from the ground up. Check out my friend Zach's excellent writing on the topic over at <a href="https://www.startupcities.com/">Startup Cities.</a>
