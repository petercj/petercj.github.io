        <b>2016 - Appalachian Trail</b> I started hiking on February 22nd and summited Mt. Katahdin on July 4th. Here's <a href="https://youtu.be/4E4UMj_eI2k">a link</a> to my friend Candlemaker's (Tim Bloemendaal) video of our thru-hike. We did a lot of the second half together, so I show up a few times!

        <b>2017 - Lowest to Highest Route</b> This route is really cool. It starts at the lowest point in the contintental US (Badwater Basin, -282 ft) and goes to the highest point (14,494 ft). Here's <a href="https://youtu.be/nYd_vZG19TY">another</a> of Candlemaker's great videos.

        <b>2019 - Cross Country Bike Tour</b> I started in San Francisco and biked south to Santa Barbara, then took a left turn and headed across the US to Charleston. It took 52 days, averaging around 68 miles a day.

        <b> 2020 - Pfiffner Traverse</b> Mile for mile, this is the hardest hike I've done. We followed <a href = "https://andrewskurka.com/adventures/pfiffner-traverse-colorado-rockies/">Andrew Skurka's route</a>, and he sure likes to hike straight off a cliff.

        <br>
        <br>
        <b>2023 - South America Trip</b> I was on sabbatical in South America from January-July. I started in Ecuador, then went to Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Colombia, and Peru. I was able to summit my first 20,000 ft mountain (<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimborazo">Chimborazo</a>), explore the Amazon, and hike Patagonia's famous W Trek in <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_del_Paine_National_Park">Torres del Paine National Park</a>.
